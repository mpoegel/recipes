<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>1 cup granulated (white) sugar</li>
<li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup unsulphured molasses</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>4 1/2 cups (639 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and salt. Set aside.</li>
<li>Using a separate mixing bowl, either with a stand mixer or a hand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugars on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and a pale yellow color, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides occasionally as needed. Mix in the eggs (one at a time) and molasses, and beat on medium-low speed until each is combined. Gradually add in the dry ingredient mixture and beat until it is evenly incorporated.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the dough is completely chilled.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
<li>Roll the dough into small balls, about 1-inch in diameter. Fill a separate small bowl with sugar, and roll each ball in the sugar until it is completely coated. Place dough balls on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the cookies begin to slightly crack on top.</li>
</ol>
