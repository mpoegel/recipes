1. Prep the fish by rinsing and patting dry. In a small bowl, stir fish rub spices together. Sprinkle all sides of fish lightly with the spice rub. Set aside.
2. Make the slaw by placing the shredded cabbage in a medium bowl. Toss with the salt. Add the onions, cilantro, jalapeño, lime juice, olive oil and toss well.
3. Grease the grill well before placing fish on it. Turn heat to medium. Grill each side a few minutes, letting grill marks develop and use a metal spatula to flip. Cook until the desired doneness and squeeze with a little lime juice.
4. Grill the tortillas until lightly charred.
