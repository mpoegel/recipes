1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and salt. Set aside.
2. Using a separate mixing bowl, either with a stand mixer or a hand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugars on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and a pale yellow color, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides occasionally as needed. Mix in the eggs (one at a time) and molasses, and beat on medium-low speed until each is combined. Gradually add in the dry ingredient mixture and beat until it is evenly incorporated.
3. Transfer the dough to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the dough is completely chilled.
4. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
5. Roll the dough into small balls, about 1-inch in diameter. Fill a separate small bowl with sugar, and roll each ball in the sugar until it is completely coated. Place dough balls on the prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the cookies begin to slightly crack on top.
